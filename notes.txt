Notes:

build go server
production: go build -o server_app.exe
debug: go build -tags debug -o server_app_debug.exe





2 do:
- mqtt protocol define, create documentation. implement on both device and server
- only get weather at a specific interval (as it is, when "update_weather" in main, it will get and send mqtt message. want to just send mqtt with already valid data)

- @bootup: server interpret device bootup msg: t=dev_bootup, m=dev_name, zip
	read/create device file based on dev_name and check that zip matches
- interpret last will testament msg: t=dev_name, m=offline OR? t=dev_offline, m=dev_name
- periodic heartbeat from/to device? (extra precaution in case LWT or dev_bootup messages insufficient)

- test:
	devices file
	weather file
	dev_bootup -> active, LWT -> inactive
	debug build

2 do Connected Device:
- @bootup: device publish t=dev_bootup, m=dev_name, zip
- implement last will testament for mqtt client at setup?
